Simple Unity Cloud Shader
This is my first attempt to create a simple noise filter for fractal clouds in Unity.
You can use other noise functions as well, such as Perlin noise or Value noise, depending on your preference.
This shader uses the Lambertian lighting model to create a simple appearance. If you want more realistic lighting, you can change the lighting model to something else, like BlinnPhong or Specular.

In the shader properties, you can control the scale, speed, lacunarity, persistence, octaves, and threshold to adjust the appearance of the fractal clouds.

To use this shader, create a new material in Unity and assign the "Custom/FractalClouds" shader to it. Then, apply the material to a quad or plane in your scene. You should now see the fractal clouds generated by the shader depending on your target platform and specific requirements. Here are some optimization tips:

    Reduce the number of octaves: Lowering the number of octaves will reduce the complexity of the noise calculation and improve performance. However, it may also reduce the level of detail in the clouds, so you'll need to find a balance between performance and visual quality.

    Bake the noise into a texture: If your cloud pattern doesn't need to change in real-time, you can bake the noise function into a texture and use the texture in the shader instead of calculating the noise on-the-fly. This will offload the noise computation to the CPU and save some GPU resources.

    Use a lower precision data type: You can try using half-precision floats instead of full-precision floats in the shader. This will reduce the amount of data the GPU needs to process and may improve performance, especially on mobile devices. However, this might result in lower visual quality due to reduced numerical precision.

    Optimize the noise function: The Simplex noise function used in the example might not be the most efficient implementation for your specific platform. You can try using other noise functions like Perlin noise or Value noise, or you can look for optimized implementations of Simplex noise.

    Use Level of Detail (LOD) techniques: Depending on the distance of the clouds from the camera, you can use lower resolution noise functions or fewer octaves to save performance. Implementing LOD techniques will allow you to maintain visual quality while optimizing for performance.

    Use Shader Variants: Create multiple versions of the shader with different levels of complexity, and switch between them at runtime based on performance requirements. This allows you to use simpler shaders on lower-end devices, ensuring a smoother experience for all users.
